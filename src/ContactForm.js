// Your form should meet the following requirements:

//     The form should have three fields: name, email, and phone with an "Add Contact" button.
//     Clicking on the "Add Contact" button invokes an onContactAdded callback function that is passed in via a prop.
//     It does not throw an error if the onContactAdded prop is undefined.
